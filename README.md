## üì¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn** / **pnpm**) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nileshyadavme/momentum.git
    cd momentum
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    # or pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Application in Development Mode:**
    Vite will start a development server and enable **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for a rapid feedback loop.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    # or pnpm dev
    ```

The application will automatically open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

```bash
npm run build
# The optimized files will be placed in the /dist directory
